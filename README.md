# Galagtris
A work in progress of a game that is a combination of Galaga and Tetris. The player controls a single cell white ship and tries to fire shots at the enemy ship above. The enemy ship goes through the different shapes of the classic Tetris pieces that everybody has come to know and love. This project is not nearly complete and is more of a foundation to be continually worked on. The future improvements include organizing the main script into subdirectories as well as: powerups, advanced difficulty settings, enhanced enemy ship fire/movement randomization (and possibly some added intelligence), player ship customization, and a new game mode. To play, download both files into a single directory and run the module "Galagtris.py" to launch the GUI and start the game. The controls are: Left/Right/Up/Down keys to move player ship; Space bar to fire; 'p' to pause; 'esc' to exit game; Right Shift to restart
